        <h1> Interest in IT</h1>

        <h3> What is your interest in IT? </h3>

        <p>
            I am interested in IT because:
            - It is applied throughout society and the everyday life of an individual<br>
             - Most human use technology every day without knowing how it works I want to understand how a how a network or program is constructed.<br>
            - The future of IT is limitless and always changing, it excites me to be a part of a fast-paced industry where I will be learning constantly.
            

        </p>

        <br><br><br>

        <h3> When did your Interest in IT start?</h3>

        <p> 
            I feel as though I’ve always been fascinated by technology and how computer work.<br> I believe my interest in IT was sparked when I was ten years old when I built my <br> first computer, I remember connecting the Peripherals and CPU to the mother board,<br> after ensuring that the pins were connected the computer came to life.
            Furthermore, two years<br> after taking up the role of a Telecommunications technician I understood the basic construct<br> of a network and configuration of router and switches.<br><br> I wanted to study information technology to learn more about IT.<br>
            I decided to study at RMIT University because it is a globally<br> recognised institution, I also asked my family friends that previously studied at RMIT,<br> and they provided the feedback which led to my enrolment in Online University Australia (OUA).<br>
            <br>Throughout my studies I wish to gain knowledge about the information technology  industry, how networks <br> and programs are created. I expect to learn how an idea is  constructed and the skills required<br> to achieve that idea (e.g. Programming Languages required for certain types of programs).

        <img src ="results.jpg" alt="ISTJ the traditionalists">
        <br><br>
        <h4><u>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</u></h4>
        <p>Each of these tests provide an insight into my personality, leadership and learning</p>
        <br>
        <h5>- Test 1: Myers-Briggs test:</h5>
        <p>This test provided the most insight into my personality, regarding workplace habits  the work that I’m doing must align with my<br>  “Values, Principals and beliefs”.  Meaning my work must promote some type of growth.
            I will be good at working in a group and <br> diffusing bad situations, As an Advocate hierarchy will not be important, I will help my colleagues if they <br> require assistance, however, “there is a risk that others will take advantage of my desire to help.”
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>- Test 2: What is you learning style?</h5>

        <p>Although this test didn’t provide as many details as the other two test it did confirm that I am a visual learner.<br> Meaning I learn best using visual  method such as drawing out diagrams using colors and writing down key words<br> and information. The results in this test mean that I must implement visual techniques to learn efficiently.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>-Test 3: Big 5 Personality Test:</h5>
        <p>For this test I received the personality type “The Traditionalist” ISTJ. This test revealed that<br> I am very “Traditional” and “Detailed oriented”. I scored the highest for sensing (59%) meaning <br> that I am realistic and practical with my expectations. This means that I will be <br> great with feasibility of a project when it comes to time and implementation.</p>
        <br>
        <h5><u>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</u></h5>
        <p> In a team regardless of my position I will be a team player, assisting my teammates when <br> and if necessary. I will be able to mediate task and solve both group and project-based issues. </p>
        <br>
        <h5><u>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</u></h5>
        <p>As the Myers – Briggs test states as an advocate I can “find ways to make nearly any position work” <br> for me. I believe I should take this into account when creating a group depending on the personality types <br> of my colleagues.
            I should be taking other colleagues' beliefs and goals into account <br> when forming a group however as an advocate I can thrive in any situation and position in a group.

        <h2>Project Idea – Raspberry PI Assistant</h2>    
        <img src ="pi.jpg" alt="Rasberry Pi">
        <h3><u>Overview:</u></h3>
        <p>Technology is used throughout our lives in many different forms. Many of ourselves find <br> that we use multiple pieces Technology when at home. The Raspberry Pi assistant will be a <br> very modern but user-friendly piece of technology that will add something to one’s life <br> rather than being another device.<br><br> 
            The Pi home assistant will be a Raspberry Pi that’s connected to a small screen. It will need to <br> be mobile enough to carry around, the PI assistant will display the users google calendar it <br> will display the weather forecast, allow the user to make notes and control home equipment<br> such as smart globes.
            </p>

        <h5><u>Motivation:</u></h5>
        <p>The Raspberry Pi assistant will be a personal home assistant that will assist users<br> that are working from home during and after this COVID – 19 period.  

        <br>

            A home assistant is a screen which functions like a tablet or computer and is powered by a lightweight computer <br>(Raspberry Pi) which displays multimedia data to the user.<br>
           
           This project will comprise of a Raspberry Pi, a tablet sized screen, smart globes, infrared sensor and camera.<br> The purpose of the home assistant is to provide its user with helpful information that is usually in several places.<br>
            
           
            The information available to the user will be simple in nature and will inform the user about their day ahead.<br> The standard information that will be displayed on the Raspberry PI home assistant will be:<br>
           
            <br><br>
           
           • Users calendar (Daily, weekly, monthly)
           <br>
           <br>
           
           • Users notes (Historical and new)
           <br>
           <br>
           
           • Front door security (using a wireless camera that’s connected to the end-users home network during this COVID period<br> this is especially helpful to remain COVID safe. Once a courier or delivery driver has left the end-user will be able to safely open their front door)
           <br>
           <br>
           • Time and Date (Widget that displays time and date in several time zones, this feature will be helpful<br> if the user works with people in different countries)
           <br>
           <br>
           • Weather and Location (these will be helpful widgets that can be easily added to the smart assistant home page)
           <br>
           <br>
            
           
           In addition to these features, the home assistant will allow the user to make notes <br> using the text to speech feature. For the implementation of this feature the programming language python will be required, there are several tutorials which <br> can be found regarding the implementation of this feature.
           <br>
           <br>
            
           
           With the use of smart globes, the user will also be able to control<br> their home lighting (color as well as brightness). This is especially helpful if there is or isn’t enough<br> lighting at the users' workstation.
           <br>
           <br>
            
           
           <br>
           The Raspberry Pi home assistant will be a time saver for its end users,<br> displaying all the relevant information required for the day ahead. Using the features outlined above the smart assistant will focus on 
           <br>
           <br>
           <br>
